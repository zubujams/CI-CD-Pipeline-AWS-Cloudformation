# CI-CD-Pipeline-AWS-Cloudformation

##### Overview: Develop a cloud-based application that serves a REST API, with an automated Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. This project will involve coding the application, containerizing it, deploying it to a cloud environment, and automating the deployment process with CI/CD tools. Incorporate monitoring, logging, and security best practices.

#### Technologies & Tools:

Programming Languages: Python (for the application) and JavaScript (for scripting within the CI/CD pipeline).
Cloud Platform: Choose a cloud platform like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for hosting the application.
Containerization: Docker for creating containerized versions of your application.
Configuration Management & IaC: Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and CloudFormation if using AWS.
CI/CD: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI for automating the deployment process.
Monitoring and Logging: Prometheus for monitoring and Grafana for visualization. ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for logging.
Security: Integrate security scanning tools like SonarQube or OWASP ZAP into your CI/CD pipeline for static code analysis and vulnerability scanning.

#### Project Steps:

Application Development:

Develop a simple REST API using Python (Flask or FastAPI could be good choices). The API could perform CRUD operations on a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) for simplicity.
Write unit and integration tests for your API.
Containerization:

Dockerize your application, ensuring it can be run in any environment that supports Docker.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

Use Terraform to define the infrastructure required to host your application on the chosen cloud platform. This should include your compute resources, networking configurations, and database services.
Alternatively, use AWS CloudFormation if you're deploying on AWS.
CI/CD Pipeline:

Set up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI. The pipeline should automate the testing, building, and deployment of your application to the cloud environment.
Incorporate steps in your pipeline for security scanning and compliance checks.
Monitoring and Logging:

Integrate Prometheus for monitoring the performance of your application.
Set up Grafana dashboards to visualize the monitoring data.
Implement the ELK Stack for logging application and infrastructure logs.
Documentation:

Document the architecture of your system, the setup of your CI/CD pipeline, and any operational procedures (e.g., how to respond to incidents, how to update the application).
